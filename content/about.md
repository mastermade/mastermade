## Hi, I'm Morgante!

I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur who has been building businesses on the web for over a decade. During that time, I have helped companies large and small to succeed with technology by developing custom web applications.

Today, I work with a small team of engineers and designers to help companies launch new projects successfully.

You can find out more about me on my [personal website](https://www.morgante.net).
